[Instructions]
Your company has decided the backup software license is frivolous and unnecessary. As a consequence, the license has not renewed. 
Your supervisor has created a simple script and an ansible playbook to create a tar archive of select files depending on pre-defined 
Ansible host groups as a stop-gap measure. You will create the inventory file to completed the backup strategy.

You must do the following:

1.  Create the inventory file in /home/ansible/inventory.
2.  Configure the host group media to contain media1 and media2.
3.  Define the following variables for media with their accompanying values:
4.  media_content should be set to /var/media/content/.
5.  media_index should be set to /opt/media/mediaIndex.
6.  Configure the host group webservers to contain the hosts web1 and web2.
7.  Define the following variables for webservers with their accompanying values:
8.  httpd_webroot should be set to /var/www/.
9.  httpd_config should be set to /etc/httpd/.
10. Define the variable script_files for specifically for web1. 
11. The value of script_files should be set to /usr/local/scripts.
12. You can run /home/ansible/scripts/backup.sh to test your inventory. 
13. If you have correctly configured the inventory, it should not error.
14. Do not edit anything in /home/ansible/scripts/.
