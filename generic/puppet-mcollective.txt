apt-get install puppet
apt-get install mcollective ruby-stomp mcollective-client
apt-get install mcollective-package-client mcollective-service-client mcollective-puppet-client
cat /etc/mcollective/client.cfg
client.cfg content i have copied in server.cfg
service mocollective restart
service activemq restart
can you tell me how to resolve this one?
you can take any connector b/w activemq/rabbitmq/stomp to make it workable
ok 
Where is activemq installation location?
i have aconfigured activemq from tar file
im going out for half and hour. you may carry on.whenever u wish to stop u may.
if it wont work in vagrant then i will give u access on ec2 instance on evening.
ok 
if u need asenything u may ping me on 8433674164.n ow im going
ok 
cooll see you late then 
ok done
u may try now
this is the issue from mcollective or activemq
it is from mcollective it is not able to reach activemq i mean 
the timeout is happen is faster or it is not pointed to mq in  right way 
I wil try to build i tfrom scratch on my machine also to try it. But i might take some timeout
cool.no worries. go on.but take ubuntu nodes.not centos/redhat
ok
so im going. im terminating tv access.let u try on ur machine and ping me.
ok
Before you go 
You ARE trying to configure puppet mcollective with  activemq as middle ware 
am i right
YES.EXACTLY
ok i will git it a shot . i will be done by today mostly ok see later then 
byue
can you go to browser and 
say
what u are searching?
The client is not able to pickup i am not getting why this should be basically a very simple configuration 
i need till tomorow i will try to recreate everything 
one min
what best i will do...i will give you access of two t2.micro ec2 instances with in 2hrs
then u may give a try from scratch
will it b fine?
i think we canot configure puppetserver on micro instance we need a bigger one it would be the same as vm on my local machine i got enough resource on my pc 
i will try it here. I would be easy and faster for me . I am using oracle vitual box
ok. i will give u access of two frsh vm with in two hrs. you may try on it by tomm
ok .
lets wrap up now. thank you for ur assistance
apt-get install mcollective ruby-stomp mcollective-client
Plus the client packages to communicate with the package, service and puppet agents:
sudo apt-get install mcollective-package-client mcollective-service-client mcollective-puppet-client
1
sudo apt-get install mcollective-package-client mcollective-service-client mcollective-puppet-client
I THINK THIS PART WILL BE DONE ON SERVER PART AND NEED TO RESTART MCOLLECTIVE SERVICE ON BOTH MACHINE
no wait i will show
